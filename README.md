# White.js

Annoyed by colors? Then you're in luck, now you can insert one script and all your images turn into pleasant black and white!

- Works for images on origin
- Works for images with CORS enabled
- Works for images without CORS enabled (using a proxy)
- Doesn't work for `file:///`
- Customize variables in the filter.

## ToDo

- Make a .min.js
- Allow calling White.init() multiple times.
- Do a dat.GUI demo.
