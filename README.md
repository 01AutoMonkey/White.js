# White.js

Annoyed by colors? Then you're in luck, now you can insert one script and all your images turn into pleasant black and white! (does not work cross-origin or file:///)

## ToDo

- Gracefully handle cross-origin and file:/// errors.
- Cleanup folder structure (e.x. make a demo folder)
- Make a .min.js
- Work correctly with domains that do allow CORS (see [here](http://enable-cors.org/), [here](https://blog.codepen.io/2013/10/08/cross-domain-images-tainted-canvas/), and [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/11/using-cors-to-load-webgl-textures-from-cross-domain-images/))
- Allow calling White.init() multiple times.
- Do a datGUI demo for the variables.
